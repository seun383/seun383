Hi there 

I'm a software engineer.

 I’m currently working on building scalable backend systems, with a strong focus on system and database design.

 I’m currently exploring serverless architectures, modern AWS cloud services, and expanding my DevOps skill set.

 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to backend development and distributed systems.

 I’m looking for guidance on performance optimization and scaling distributed applications.

 Ask me about system design, database optimization, or effective concurrency management.
