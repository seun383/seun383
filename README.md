Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer.

🔭 I’m currently working on building scalable backend systems, with a strong focus on system and database design.

🌱 I’m currently exploring serverless architectures, modern AWS cloud services, and expanding my DevOps skill set.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to backend development and distributed systems.

🤔 I’m looking for guidance on performance optimization and scaling distributed applications.

💬 Ask me about system design, database optimization, or effective concurrency management.
